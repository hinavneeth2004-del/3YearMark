This girl came into my life on a random September day where I asked her to watch my bag whilst not knowing I would be wanting to just watch her for the rest of the degree. I am starting this smol initiative to remind ourselves that this is how we started and the crosswords we made for eachother, the 5 love language box we made, these are the moments we felt love was overflowing and it had to take some other form. Every time I see a couple here, I can’t believe I am here in a place which would only make sense with you, in fact every place I go, where I study, where I work they are all great but they don’t make sense unless they are accompanied by someone who taps their legs and wants power naps. Someone who loves keeping her leg on top of mine (WHICH I HOPE IS SOMETHING SHE ONLY DOES WITH ME). Someone who desperately, irretrievably can’t live without coffee (Thought I’ll say me ah? Chi).\n\nThings have been tough even though everything else in life might feel perfect. I guess thats what we had, when everything was shit we had each other and that’s something I wanted to remind each other. After going through all the beautiful seasons, trees might feel like shit when fall comes no? I think this is just a period of our life where we appreciate each other, put in that extra effort. Systematically block time for each other and fall in love hopelessly just like 3 years ago.\n\nCome back to this page everyday until the 1st to find what I feel about you which is a lot of love:))\n\nI have made it easy as fuck for you lazy fuck so just check your calendar everyday in the morning.",
