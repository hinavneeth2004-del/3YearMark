This girl came into my life on a random September day where I asked her to watch my bag whilst not knowing I would be wanting to just watch her for the rest of the degree. I am starting this smol initiative to remind ourselves that this is how we started and the crosswords we made for eachother, the 5 love language box we made, these are the moments we felt love was overflowing and it had to take some other form. Every time I see a couple here, I can’t believe I am here in a place which would only make sense with you, in fact every place I go, where I study, where I work they are all great but they don’t make sense unless they are accompanied by someone who taps their legs and wants power naps. Someone who loves keeping her leg on top of mine (WHICH I HOPE IS SOMETHING SHE ONLY DOES WITH ME). Someone who desperately, irretrievably can’t live without coffee (Thought I’ll say me ah? Chi).\n\nThings have been tough even though everything else in life might feel perfect. I guess thats what we had, when everything was shit we had each other and that’s something I wanted to remind each other. After going through all the beautiful seasons, trees might feel like shit when fall comes no? I think this is just a period of our life where we appreciate each other, put in that extra effort. Systematically block time for each other and fall in love hopelessly just like 3 years ago.\n\nCome back to this page everyday until the 1st to find what I feel about you which is a lot of love:))\n\nI have made it easy as fuck for you lazy fuck so just check your calendar everyday in the morning.  I love you",
  "2025-09-23": "I am reminded of our first meeting proper one in the turf for priyanshu’s bday. Sam had introduced you and I remember thinking ambo but obviously did not do anything hahah. While the three years seem like a blur to me now random moments, random memories come to mind like one of these days I was thinking about the day when I ran outside class to get a lavender flower for you because your mood was off or when you first told me you want to date near the lib side with a diary milk, diary milk was a constant huh throughout ( NO WONDER I DONT HAVE ABS). When I struggle to wake up here I think about the umpteeeeeen number of times I call you in the morning in different intervals STILL WONT GET UP but now you survive like a beast on 3 hour of sleep. Im so proud of your growth, I feel like if I spend a day with you like professionally I wouldnt recognise the laayu who forgets her laptop charger EVERYWHERE. The first thought I had when I bought shawarma here was when how I used to buy after dropping you and you would call me and You would just know that I was waiting outside venkys for a CHEEEESY one. I can’t believe we said goodnight to eachother like with a hug and kiss that shits so healthy I think everyone needs that in life no? I feel so physically UNLOVED here need me some of the most beautiful girl (THERE ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL DONT ARGUE, FOR ME YOU ARE IT).   As we count down to three years, it must make us think that we did not spend 12,31,200 minutes of our lives together for no reason. It’s like that dialogue from HIMYM -  “Thank every God there is or ever was or will be and the whole universe and anyone else I could possibly thank. That I saw that beautiful girl on that chilly shamirpet campus and that I had the guts to stand up, walk over to her, tap her on the shoulder, open my mouth and say nennuuu niinnuuu premisthannunuu",
